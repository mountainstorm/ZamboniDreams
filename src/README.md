ZamboniDreams
=============

This is a simple game, developed in HaxePunk to learn the library and get used to how to active real world results using Haxe and HaxePunk.

It uses a simple 3D orthographic camera and clipping polygon, pulled from Blender3D, and pre-rendered visuals to provide a nice Zamboni (Ice resurfacer) game.
